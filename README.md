# AI-Demo

## Recent Maintenance

**October 2025:**
- Removed a large backup file (`AI-Demo-backup.zip`) from the repository and git history to resolve GitHub push issues caused by exceeding the 100 MB file size limit.
- Cleaned the workspace and updated `.gitignore` to prevent large files from being committed in the future.
- Used `git filter-repo` to fully remove the file from all commit history and force-pushed the cleaned branch to GitHub.

If you need to create backups, do not add large files to the repository. Use external storage or cloud solutions for large assets.
